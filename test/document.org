** Some headline

  Just a simple paragraph with some content

  This is an equation: @x + 1 > yÂ²@

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
 which changes
   indentation
without notice!
  #+END_QUOTE

  + Here starts a list with an item
    continuing here
  but 
broken here
  + Another item

    With a second paragraph

    - A sublist starts here, with subnumbers
      1. [@5] item 5
      6. item 6
         #+BEGIN_VERSE
Oh here is some poetry
That does not even rhyme
    Why should we care, dear?
It's all over now.
         #+END_VERSE
      10. item 7
    - And continues
        here
    * Another item 
     delimiter
    And a third paragraph

  + Third outer item
  And closing paragraph.


  My favorite scenes are (in this order)
        1. The attack of the Rohirrim
        2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
           + this was already my favorite scene in the book
           + I really like Miranda Otto.
        3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
           - on DVD only
           He makes a really funny face when it happens.
        But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
        Important actors in this film are:
        - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
        - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
          him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.

** Some headline again
  Here is a message:

  This is a *quoted message*
  with the caret-notation
  and continuing

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This is a quoted message with the begin,end notation.
    -- Al Eintein & Dick Feynman, /Rambling thoughts/ @III.2.
  #+END_QUOTE

  #+BEGIN_CENTER
  Centered text?
  #+END_CENTER

  + This is a list item starting with a plus
    + This is another list item starting with a plus
      and the content
      + can be indented just anyhow
      as long as I don't come back at
      the same indentation level as the plus

  - This is a list item starting with a minus

  * This is a list item starting with a star

  Here is an equation: $4 y = x^2 + x + 1$

  Here is a long equation: $$y = x^2 + x + 1$$

* Header                                                            :my:tags:

*** Introduction

    Ok, there is some text alright.

    : Look : some code here !
    : This is a sample code.

    And here also.

    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript -n
      var toto = 1;                         (ref:toto)
      var tutu = {
        arr: [],
        obj: ()
      };
    #+END_SRC
